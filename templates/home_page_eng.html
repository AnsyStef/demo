                Monument in honor of the 850th anniversary of Vladimir
The monument was laid on August 23, 1958 to perpetuate a significant date in the history of Vladimir, and was inaugurated only on October 30, 1960.
In fact, this significant date took place much earlier, but in Soviet times it was customary to think that it was not about Vladimir the Baptist, who founded the city of Vladimir in 990, but about Vladimir Monomakh.<br>
The monument was created by two sculptors: A. N. Dushkin and D. B. Ryabichev. Externally, the monument is a 22-meter truncated pyramid with three sides. The monument is made of white stone and stands on a marble base.<br>
At the foot, in the recesses of the faces, there are three three-meter bronze figures that symbolize the past and present of the city: an ancient Russian warrior with a sword and an architect with a column capital on his knees, as well as a modern worker with a tractor model in his hands. Bas-reliefs illustrating important pages of the history of the city and its heroes are carved above the bronze figures. Above the ancient architect there are medallions with portraits of Vladimir Monomakh and Andrei Bogolyubsky, as well as bas–reliefs with themes of Vladimir architecture and ancient artistic craft. Above the warrior there are medallions with portraits of Alexander Nevsky and Dmitry Pozharsky and bas–reliefs depicting significant events for Vladimir history: Alexander Nevsky's entry into the city for the Grand duchy in 1252 and the gathering of the people's militia by Prince Dmitry Pozharsky in 1612. Above the worker's head, the bas-reliefs reflect the heroic events of the 20th century associated with the Civil War and the Great Patriotic War, as well as the transfer of the 150-thousandth tractor "Vladimirets" to collective farmers in 1957. The placement of bronze figures on the monument is also symbolic: the architect faces the ancient Assumption Cathedral, the warrior looks at the defensive Golden Gate, the worker looks at the eastern industrial district of the city.
